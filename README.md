# ShaguDPS

A very small and lightweight damage meter. The combat log is parsed in a locale-independent way and should work on every 1.12 (vanilla) and 2.4.3 (burning crusade) based client.

Credit for the addon goes to Shagu (https://github.com/shagu). I merely added another view showing dps and damage in the same window.
